**TECHNICAL EXPIRIENCE**

### **Game Knight \- Enemy AI & Combat Systems (Unity)**

*Wrocław, Poland* *April 2025 – September 2025*

* Engineered a modular Enemy AI system that reduced behavior iteration time by roughly 30%, achieved by developing custom debugging tools and visualizers for state machine logic .  
* Optimized physics-based movement to maintain high performance under load, by implementing efficient pathfinding algorithms and spatial partitioning.  
* Facilitated a "simulated production" environment by establishing a strict version control workflow and conducting code reviews to ensure clean, decoupled architecture.

### **CommerceHub \- AI Inventory Backend (SynderHacks Hackathon)**

*Wrocław, Poland* *November 2025*

* Engineered a scalable inventory backend that processed real-time e-commerce data, by designing a RESTful API with Python/FastAPI and implementing code review standards for the ETL pipeline.  
* Developed a predictive demand model  with high accuracy , achieved by training ARIMA models and documenting the data engineering process for reproducibility .  
* Delivered a fully working product in under 24 hours in a team of 4, which was handling any scale business with live predictions and analytics. 

### **Unity Turn-Based Card Battler (Game Jam)**

*Wrocław, Poland* *July 2025*

* Delivered a feature-complete combat prototype in under 24 hours by prioritizing core mechanics and creating a shared documentation and ecosystem for card interactions, creation, and other edge cases.  
* Designed a scalable "Buff/Debuff" system that supported instant content expansion, achieved by utilizing ScriptableObjects and implementing a robust custom debug console for testing damage calculations.  
* Engineered a fully working system by creating a special multipurpose infrastructure that handles health, stamina (turns), and a card drafting system.

### **Unity 2D Exploration Game (Game Jam)**

*Wrocław, Poland* *April 2025*

* Implemented atmospheric game mechanics including dynamic lighting and resource depletion, by writing custom shaders and optimizing the rendering pipeline for smooth visual transitions .  
* Architected a persistent game state manager using Dependency Injection , ensuring data integrity across scene loads and modular code structure.
